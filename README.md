  <b>Architected Intelligence</b><br/>
  Technical architecture reports from the Metaventions ecosystem — from research papers to production systems.
</p>

---

## What Is This?

**Paper to Production** is a curated collection of technical architecture reports that trace the journey from academic research to deployed, measurable AI systems. Each report is a self-contained, interactive web document with architecture diagrams, benchmarks, and implementation details.

This is not a blog. Every report is backed by real system telemetry, real DQ scores, and real production deployments.

## Reports

| Report | Date | Key Metrics |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [The 28-Wire Nervous System](https://paper-to-production.vercel.app/28-wire-nervous-system-report) | March 11, 2026 | DQ 0.704 → 0.952 · +32% in one session · 28 wires · SUPERMAX +12.4% |

> How 17 isolated AI components were wired into a compound intelligence engine — with measurable DQ improvement, autonomous SUPERMAX escalation, and 6 closed feedback loops.

## Repository Structure

```
paper-to-production/
├── index.html                              # Landing page — report index
├── 28-wire-nervous-system-report/
│   └── index.html                          # Full interactive architecture report
├── vercel.json                             # Routing & deployment config

└── README.md
```

## How It Works

Each report lives in its own directory as a standalone `index.html` — no build step, no framework, no dependencies. The landing page (`/index.html`) serves as an index that links to all published reports.

**Stack:**
- Pure HTML/CSS — zero JavaScript dependencies
- Inter + JetBrains Mono typography
- Dark theme (`#08080d` base) with Metaventions accent palette (`#E8754A` amber, `#4A9EE8` blue, `#4AE8A0` green)
- Deployed to Vercel with clean URL rewrites

## Adding a New Report

1. Create a new directory: `my-report-name/index.html`
2. Add a rewrite rule in `vercel.json`:
   ```json
   { "source": "/my-report-name", "destination": "/my-report-name/index.html" }
   ```
3. Add a report card to the landing page `index.html`
4. Push to `main` — Vercel deploys automatically

## Part of the Metaventions Ecosystem

Paper to Production is one component of the **Metaventions D-Ecosystem** — a sovereign AI infrastructure built on cognitive equity, DQ-scored routing, and compound intelligence.
